			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Question from reader:<br/>
Dear Mr. Fulford,<br/>
<br/>
 I have been following your weekly updates every Monday for the past three or four months, perhaps even longer. I must confess that at first I was rather skeptical about the White Dragon Society, the Pentagon sources that always seem to be saying something or the other, and the robotic voice. But I am a historian at heart, always on the lookout for the newest piece of evidence, for that missing piece that will fall into place and thus clarify all the madness and the chaos and the despair we are living today.<br/>
<br/>
Two days ago, I visited your blog for the first time. This is how I obtained this email address, which, I hope is truly your address and that it is you and not someone else who is reading this mail.<br/>
<br/>
With the passing of time, your weekly updates have made me feel optimistic about the future of humanity and the world as a whole. I, too, realized some time ago that the world is being run by lunatics. I assume these lunatics are the people you refer to as the Khazarian Mafia. If they had a Plan B, so to speak, besides wanting to hole up in Starlight mountain or whatever other bunker they might have, their sheer recklessness would make sense. As it is, however, if they blow up the world, they blow up with it as well. Not to be a worry rat, but this madness has to stop. According to your robot, apparently it will. I can’t wait.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Now, my question is, what will happen to Palestine then? Will the Holocaust lies be revealed once and for all? Will the Palestinians return to their land? Will the occupiers give up this land so easily? Unlike many people, I am aware that the only thing sustaining the false state of Israel besides the sheer obstinacy of the Rothschild-controled Knesset is the Holocaust Hoax. Without this persecution myth, the occupation of Palestine loses all hope of legitimacy.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Personally, I have many friends of the Jewish faith. How different they are from the psychopaths pushing for extermination of the Arab population of Palestine! If it is the Khazarian Mafia pushing for this outcome, then by all means, do arrest them or even execute them, as you say it may be necessary in your 14 July update. What matters is the good of the many, and for this it may be necessary to sacrifice the few. Or altogether send them to Mars, since it is they who are so interested in the colonization of that planet. Do permit them to take all the gold they’ve been hoarding for the past 300 years. Let us see the good it will make them there.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I understand that you may be too busy to respond to my mail. I do hope, however, to get a satisfactory answer to my questions. This is an issue that both intrigues me and worries me.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Good luck in your endeavors, and by all means, do continue the fight. There are people out here who root for you. Should you need any help besides the monetary one, do not hesitate to send a smoke signal.<br/>
<br/>
BF reply:<br/>
<br/>
The robot voice is actually a robot that posts my subscription blog without my permission. My own voice is distinctly human.<br/>
<br/>
Israel will become a Jewish autonomous zone within a loose Muslim republic and many of its citizens will leave when they find out how much they have been lied to. The Palestinians will get their own state within the republic.<br/>
<br/>
Also, you can help by spreading the truth because the truth will set us free.<br/>

pop goes the public epiphany if this story goes viral<br/>
perhaps more insiders will come forward now<br/>

It is all coming out now. It will be like the fall of the Soviet Union. Some rare information will appear in public until a new regime imposes secrecy again. We need to record and make public as much as we can during this period.<br/>

</p>
In the above links you are posting classified collateral account bonds and then you are soliciting gold be used from the collateral accounts via the P2 Freemason Lodge, out of Italy I believe, to finance operations for the White Dragon Society. Both actions are illegal. This is no different than Henry Kissinger going to Russia and talking to Putin pretending to be the sole signatory of the collateral accounts, when there is no doubt Putin knows the game Kissinger is attempting. Or when he coerces the Emperor of Japan to &quot;sign off&quot; on bonds.<br/>
This needs to stop.<br/>
The P2 Freemason Lodge, Henry Kissinger and the White Dragon Society needs to stop all their operations against the collateral accounts, including making claims in regards to the collateral accounts in any capacity and ALL assets belonging to the collateral accounts need to be immediately returned.<br/>
Feel free to send this email to the parties mentioned above and I welcome them or yourself to contact me because the last I heard David Crayford and American Lawyer were not happy campers.<br/>
<br/>
BF Reply:<br/>
<br/>
The link you provided does not show the WDS making claims to the gold. I am reporting what the Vatican P2 lodge was trying to do. The financial instrument pictured there is in the possession of the P2 and it was them who made their images public. I did suggest to them that if there was so much gold that they needed to provide proof that it actually exists and they could do that by actually physically producing some for neutral third parties to see.<br/>
The WDS has proposed setting up a meritocratically staffed future planning agency to plan humanity&#39;s future but it does not claim ownership of the global collateral accounts and never has. Furthermore the WDS has no interest in running this future planning agency or claiming ownership to any funds put at its disposal. At this point though, we are giving up on these accounts and moving to crypto-currencies backed by real world assets in no way linked to these probably mythical accounts.<br/>
By the way, there is a fake White Dragon Society home page that has nothing to do with us. We are mostly an analogue organization working in the real world because the digital world has been too compromised to be trusted. The WDS supports democracy, meritocracy, freedom of speech, the rule of law and human rights. Our membership is mostly Western but we do not believe in artificial East/West/North/South divides. We are all human beings from the planet earth.<br/>

				<p>Sounds like &quot;American Lawyer&quot; and David Crayford have provided a missing link for me in this article:<br/></p>

	<a href="http://abundanthope.net/pages/Whistleblower_and_OITC_114/AMERICAN-LAWYER-------Hotdogs-fireworks-and-apple-tea-with-David-P-Crayford-and-Secret-Agent-Man-Sam-and-an-explosive-Happy-Birthday-to-America.shtml">http://abundanthope.net/pages/Whistleblower_and_OITC_114/AMERICAN-LAWYER-------Hotdogs-fireworks-and-apple-tea-with-David-P-Crayford-and-Secret-Agent-Man-Sam-and-an-explosive-Happy-Birthday-to-America.shtml</a>
</p>
While we hear their buzz words like &quot;Cabal&quot; &quot;Deep State&quot; and similar labels, we almost never see a face to the ones who think they are the sole signatory to the collateral accounts and are behind the blockage of these accounts, so they are never used for the benefit of humanity.<br/>
Henry Kissinger, who needs no introduction is that person and I invite all of you to read the above article written by &quot;American lawyer&quot; and confirmed by David Crayford. It lends an explanation as to why Kissinger has been talking to Vladimir Putin.<br/>
I invite you to read the article above and comment if you wish?<br/>
<br/>
First of all, we both seem to have our own direct sources who confirm that Henry Kissinger is indeed laying claim to be the sole signatory for the collateral accounts. Our sources also agree that Kissinger obtained this claim fraudulently.<br/>
I can add from my own sources, that Kissinger arranged for me to visit Bougainville where some mercenary troops tried to kill me. While I was there Kissinger managed to convince or blackmail the Japanese Emperor into signing off on a 4.3 quadrillion yen bond (actually it was 5 quadrillion yen but 7000 trillion had been paid out in advance).<br/>
Kissinger is, according to my Japanese royal family sources, hoping to use this money to finance a world government and is flying around the world using his connections to try to make this happen.<br/>
However, David Crayford once again slanders me by calling me a fraud. He says the net is closing in on me and that I am being reduced to begging. It is a fact that Finance Minister Taro Aso, who works for the French branch of the Rothschilds, arranged a bogus tax lien claiming I owed 10 years’ worth of payroll taxes and consumption taxes that I had already paid. Then, as it became clear I would be able to pay off even those bogus taxes, they arranged to have my paypal account shut down. In other words, these people are resorting to fraud to shut down my legitimate income from subscribers to my newsletter and from book publishing in Japan. Crayford, through his words, has revealed that he is a Rothschild agent.<br/>
Also, I do not think humanity wants all of its money to be controlled by a single, secret individual. As I have always said, the creation of money should be a transparent, publicly owned utility and not a private monopoly.<br/>
It has become obvious we cannot wait forever for these global collateral accounts to work for humanity so we are bypassing the old system using asset backed crypto-currencies. We will use assets that the Khazarians cannot possibly claim as theirs.<br/>

				<p>North Korea (a proxy for Japan) has 5000 nuclear ICBMs<br/>
<br/>
By Benjamin Fulford<br/>
July 5, 2017<br/>
<br/>
The fuss about North Korea launching an ICBM “that could reach Alaska,” is fake news. North Korea is a proxy for the Japanese deep state. Former Russian President Boris Yeltsin once leaked that Japan’s leaders, while keeping a façade as heads of a peace loving, non-nuclear state, tell top world leaders Japan has 5000 nuclear armed ICBMs.<br/>
It is public knowledge that Japan has manufactured enough plutonium for 5000 atomic bombs. It is also public knowledge that Japan is a first rate space power. Put them together and you do not need Boris Yeltsin to spell it out for you. Japan will never strike first but it is also no longer going to allow itself to be bullied.<br/>
There is a change going on at the highest levels of the Japanese secret government now that David Rockefeller is dead. The demolition of the Liberal Democratic Party at the Tokyo elections is just the first step. The next step will be for a revised Tanaka faction to take over at the national level. The final step will be to remove the Bank of Japan from Khazarian control and thus free the yen to finance a new future for the planet.<br/>

Spotted this in an article entitled &quot;Forces of Light and Darkness&quot;, which is divided in &quot;positive&quot; groups, mixed, and negative groups. WDS was amongst the &quot;mixed&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
White Dragon Society. This group represents interests of some old Chinese royal lineages, supported with many martial arts groups around the world. Their contact person is Benjamin Fulford. Their main motivation is to bring down the Cabal, but their motives may not be completely pure, as they see their role in the new society after the Event as a little bit too dominant and controlling. They also have a strong financial interest in the funds that will be released after the take down of the Cabal. Actually the Resistance [Movement] had some problems with them in February [2012] at secret negotiations about the new financial system and this has resulted in some delays in timeline for the Event.<br/>

My reply<br/>
Thanks for that but I have no idea what they meant about February 2012. Also, we have CIA, Pentagon, MI6, FSB, North Korean, gnostic illuminati, Japanese military intelligence etc, members and are not just supported by martial arts groups. The Asian royals are allied but separate from us.<br/>
We have stopped the plan to kill 90% of humanity. We now support the creation of a meritocratically staffed future planning agency charged with the job of ending poverty, stopping environmental destruction and then setting humanity on a path for exponential expansion into the universe. We also support democracy, human rights, the rule of law and freedom of the press.<br/>

				<p>The Mouse that Roared or how the people of Bougainville defeated the Rothschilds<br/>
<br/>
By Benjamin Fulford<br/>
2017/06/21<br/>
<br/>
The Island of Bougainville in the South Pacific has been the scene of an epic decades-long struggle that resulted in locals, armed only with axes and bows, defeating troops armed with the latest world class weaponry. The battle pitched the natives fighting to retain their ancestral homes against a Rothschild multinational fighting to steal the worlds’ largest gold deposits at the Panguna mine. As a result of their victory the Nasioi people of Central Bougainville became the first indigenous peoples in the world to force a global mining multinational to give up one of its richest ventures.<br/>
This is not just a local matter because there is so much gold on that Island that it could affect the future of the global financial system. The international bankers say there are only a few tens of billions of dollars’ worth of gold and copper there, but, if we use the fractional reserve methods employed by the Federal Reserve Board in 2008 to price gold (700 tons of gold was turned into 750,000 tons worth of gold backed bonds), then it is worth hundreds of trillions of dollars.<br/>
Furthermore, locals say the mine was covering up a massive money laundering operation by claiming gold was copper, meaning the mine, and six other known rich gold reserves on the island, are potentially worth hundreds of trillions of dollars even without fractional reserve magic. “They would take the gold out at night and hide it in caves,” according to Bougainville Revolutionary Army sources.<br/>
The mine was operated by Rio Tinto Zinc from 1972 until 1989 before the locals shut it down, emerging victorious after a decade long war that resulted in the death of about 30,000 people or more than 10% of the population, according to BRA sources. A BRA general, “Joel” describes how the unarmed rebels were able to defeat a state of the art army. “When we first attacked them we only had axes and spears and knew that many of us would die,” he says. “We used guerilla tactics, we attacked one soldier and took his gun, with that gun we could kill 3 or 4 other soldiers and take their guns and so on; that is how we armed ourselves,” he says.<br/>
Red Cross officials working on the island also say that to this day there are extra-judicial murders and many “disappeared people,” as a result of the conflict on the island.<br/>
Furthermore, the resistance army won the war only to face a blockade that, to some extent, continues to this day.<br/>
Rio Tinto Zinc claims they have handed over control of the mine to Bougainville Copper Limited (BCL) that is mostly owned by the Autonomous Government of Bougainville (ABG). Rio Tinto also claims they are not liable for the enormous environmental damage they caused by dumping mercury and other poisonous mine slurry into a local river because they were abiding by local laws at the time. However, if you take a look at Bougainville Island on Google Earth you can still see clearly, decades after the mine closed, the scars on the landscape caused by it. They should not be allowed to get away with environmental destruction so great that it shows up on satellite photos.<br/>
The Twin Kingdom of Meekamui and Papala, the locals’ name for the island, is headed by King David Peii II who wants to charge the owners of Rio Tinto with war crimes and sue them for environmental destruction at the International Court of Justice in the Hague.<br/>
The BCL people for their part, are trying to re-open the mine and promise to be nice to the environment this time but the locals are so bitter about the mass murder and environmental destruction that they do not want BCL or ABG to have any role whatsoever in the mine.<br/>
This is how King David views the situation:<br/>
<br/>
ABG (Autonomous Bougainville Government) is simply an agent of the Government of Papua New Guinea. Its headquarters are located at Waigani, PNG. Whoever controls PNG also controls ABG. As you might be aware Australia granted independence to PNG in 1975. However, Australia still de facto controls PNG. According to 2011 statistics Australia raked about K19.8 Billion PGK [Papua New Guinea Kina, 1 kina=0.31 US dollars] from its companies in PNG but only gave about K450 million PGK back in the form of AusAid. That&#39;s about 3% only; 97% is retained in Australia. The borrower is a slave to the lender. PNGeans are happy to receive AusAid funds for their projects but don&#39;t know the real story.<br/>
ABG, was established because the Bougainville leadership split up immediately after winning the 10-year war against PNG and BCL/Rio Tinto. The VP Joseph Kabui decided to negotiate with the PNG Government due to lack of funds for services, etc, while the President Francis Ona did not think it was right to negotiate. Though both have now died and gone their successors are still alive and active. I am the successor of the late Francis Ona under the Twin Kingdom Agreement.<br/>
ABG is down at the bottom end of the international food chain of that old control system, and therefore, cannot say nay to BCL, Rio Tinto, PNG, Australia or their hierarchies or controllers because &quot;it&#39;s a slave to its lenders&quot;.<br/>
BCL (B&#39;ville Copper Ltd) is still owned by foreigners (or non-Bougainvilleans). The shares they claim to have given to ABG are still controlled by foreigners because ABG itself is a foreign agent on Bougainville anyway. ABG was established by its financiers (PNG & Australia, etc) to serve their own interests in our sovereign island nation.<br/>
<br/>
What King David describes is true of much of the developing world where ruthless multinationals pillage the land with the help of mercenaries and locally hired and bribed “leaders.” It is estimated that multinationals loot Africa alone to the tune of $60 billion a year.<br/></p>

<p class="asset asset-link">
	<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/jul/15/aid-africa-west-looting-continent">https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/jul/15/aid-africa-west-looting-continent</a>
</p>
In that sense, the battle for Bougainville’s gold could mark a global turning point because King David promises to use the vast funds from the mine to help other developing countries. Countries in Africa and other developing parts of the world would do far better being paid a fair price for their resources than receiving often useless “foreign aid” from the countries that are looting them.<br/>
In any case, it is clear that somebody powerful went to a lot of trouble to try to prevent this writer from visiting King David. First of all, all flights into and out of Port Moresby in Papua New Guinea were cancelled the day after our arrival for unspecified reasons. The result was to delay the arrival of King David’s representative, Mealagan Krishnan. Also, even though there are daily flights to the town of Arawa, a two and a half hour drive from the Kingdom’s capital, these flights were mysteriously cancelled during the week of our visit. We were forced to take a flight to the town of Boka, a grueling 7 hour drive from the Kingdom and when we got there we found the main road was blocked by “a huge accident” forcing us to go by boat and back roads.<br/>
One final literal roadblock was manned by BCL thugs who demanded a $1000 bribe to let us pass. When I told their boss “you cannot squeeze blood from a stone,” he answered “I can squeeze blood from a stone.” After much haggling we paid a $100 dollar cash bribe and were allowed to continue on our way. Overall, our arrival was delayed by 4 days.<br/>
Finally, after meeting the King we were offered a tour of the Panguna mine on the following day. However, instead we were roused in the middle of the night with a warning that 10 truckloads of mercenaries and corrupt police officers were on their way to try to force the land-owners of the Panguna mine to sign over the rights of the mine to BCL. We were also told they would try to kill us.<br/>
The locals felled trees across the road and set up armed road-blocks to stop the mercenaries from chasing us after we left. Armed conflict was avoided at the last minute but the BRA told us it was our arrival that led to the dispatch of the mercenaries.<br/>
In any case, as a result of our visit, we will be appealing for international help to allow the locals to develop the mine on their own in an environmentally friendly manner. The King promises the billions or trillions of dollars that will flow from the mine will be used to help the people of Bougainville and the world.<br/>
Though many of the Bougainevillians we met were barefoot, they carried smart-phones and knew more about the true nature of the international financial system than the average reporter from the Wall Street Journal seems to (I have met many of them over the years). I would rather have King David in charge of the Bougainville gold than the ruthless and incompetent Khazarian central bank gangsters who have done so much harm to this planet and its people.<br/>
Both Rio Tinto Zinc and BCL ignored multiple attempts by this writer to contact them.<br/>

ABG is down at the bottom end of the international food chain of that old control system, and therefore, cannot say nay to BCL, Rio Tinto, PNG, Australia or their hierarchies or controllers because &quot;it&#39;s a slave to its lenders&quot;.<br/>
BCL (B&#39;ville Copper Ltd) is still owned by foreigners (or non-Bougainvilleans). The shares they claim to have given to ABG are still controlled by foreigners because ABG itself is a foreign agent on Bougainville anyway. ABG was established by its financiers (PNG & Australia, etc) to serve their own interests in our sovereign island nation.<br/>
<br/>
What King David describes is true of much of the developing world where ruthless multinationals pillage the land with the help of mercenaries and locally hired and bribed “leaders.” It is estimated that multinationals loot Africa alone to the tune of $60 billion a year.<br/></p>

<p class="asset asset-link">
	<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/jul/15/aid-africa-west-looting-continent">https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/jul/15/aid-africa-west-looting-continent</a>
</p>
In that sense, the battle for Bougainville’s gold could mark a global turning point because King David promises to use the vast funds from the mine to help other developing countries. Countries in Africa and other developing parts of the world would do far better being paid a fair price for their resources than receiving often useless “foreign aid” from the countries that are looting them.<br/>
In any case, it is clear that somebody powerful went to a lot of trouble to try to prevent this writer from visiting King David. First of all, all flights into and out of Port Moresby in Papua New Guinea were cancelled the day after our arrival for unspecified reasons. The result was to delay the arrival of King David’s representative, Mealagan Krishnan. Also, even though there are daily flights to the town of Arawa, a two and a half hour drive from the Kingdom’s capital, these flights were mysteriously cancelled during the week of our visit. We were forced to take a flight to the town of Boka, a grueling 7 hour drive from the Kingdom and when we got there we found the main road was blocked by “a huge accident” forcing us to go by boat and back roads.<br/>
One final literal roadblock was manned by BCL thugs who demanded a $1000 bribe to let us pass. When I told their boss “you cannot squeeze blood from a stone,” he answered “I can squeeze blood from a stone.” After much haggling we paid a $100 dollar cash bribe and were allowed to continue on our way. Overall, our arrival was delayed by 4 days.<br/>
Finally, after meeting the King we were offered a tour of the Panguna mine on the following day. However, instead we were roused in the middle of the night with a warning that 10 truckloads of mercenaries and corrupt police officers were on their way to try to force the land-owners of the Panguna mine to sign over the rights of the mine to BCL. We were also told they would try to kill us.<br/>
The locals felled trees across the road and set up armed road-blocks to stop the mercenaries from chasing us after we left. Armed conflict was avoided at the last minute but the BRA told us it was our arrival that led to the dispatch of the mercenaries.<br/>
In any case, as a result of our visit, we will be appealing for international help to allow the locals to develop the mine on their own in an environmentally friendly manner. The King promises the billions or trillions of dollars that will flow from the mine will be used to help the people of Bougainville and the world.<br/>
Though many of the Bougainevillians we met were barefoot, they carried smart-phones and knew more about the true nature of the international financial system than the average reporter from the Wall Street Journal seems to (I have met many of them over the years). I would rather have King David in charge of the Bougainville gold than the ruthless and incompetent Khazarian central bank gangsters who have done so much harm to this planet and its people.<br/>
Both Rio Tinto Zinc and BCL ignored multiple attempts by this writer to contact them.<br/>
